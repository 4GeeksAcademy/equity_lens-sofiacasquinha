CPS variables:

NOTES: VARIABLES WITH A q AT THE BEGINNING ARE DATA QUALITY FLAGS. ANY VALUE GREATER THAN ZERO INDICATES SOME ISSUE WITH DATA QUALITY. THE EARNINGS DATA WITH ZEROS WAS ONLY USED DURING THE CREATION OF THIS VARIABLE. DUE TO LACK OF DATA AVAILABILITY for 1981, ALL OF THE HOURS AND WEEKS DATA WERE FORCED TO USE REGARDLESS OF THE DATA QUALITY FLAG.
THE ORIGINAL CPS VARIABLES HAVE BEEN KEPT.
OCCUPATION AND INDUSTRY WERE NOT USED IN THE CPS ANALYSIS.
THE VARIABLES WITH tc AT THE BEGINNING INDICATE TOPCODED VALUES.
